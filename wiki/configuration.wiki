The configuration options for the module allow you to enter the details of OLSA Server your organisation is using, choose how often old sessionids are purged from the database and configure the tracking mode for the courses.

==!SkillSoft OLSA !EndPoint==
This is URL to the Web Services and is unique for each customer. This value is supplied by !SkillSoft when you have licensed OLSA.

==!SkillSoft OLSA Customer ID==
This is OLSA Customer ID and is unique for each customer. This value is supplied by !SkillSoft when you have licensed OLSA.

==!SkillSoft OLSA Shared Secret==
This is OLSA Shared Secret and is unique for each customer. This value is supplied by !SkillSoft when you have licensed OLSA.

==Number of hours to keep sessionid==
Every time a user launches an asset a new unique sessionid is created for session tracking purposes, this value determines how often the completed sessions are purged from the database. The purpose is to keep the database table size as small as possible.

==!SkillSoft Tracking Mode==
This determines where asset usage data is returned. With "Track to LMS" the aicc usage data for an asset, such as score, time spent is immediately sent to Moodle.

With "Track to OLSA" mode the data is initially stored in !SkillSofts servers, making advanced functionality such as download support available, and then the data is automatically synchronised back to Moodle.

==Moodle/!SkillSoft User Identifier (NEW! April 2010)==
This option determines which value from Moodle is used for the OLSA Username, this is critical when "Track to OLSA" is used to allow synchronisation of data.

You can choose between using the Moodle generated unique user id (user->id) or the Moodle Username (user->username).

There are benefits to using the unique Moodle generated user id, especially when using "Track To OLSA" mode, as it is possible to change a users username which would result in duplicate accounts been created in OLSA.

The benefit of using the username, is that it makes it easier to use "Track to OLSA" mode when potentially user could be accessing the OLSA server via !SkillSofts !SkillPort LMS, via additional portal integrations etc. So long as the "username" in all these systems is the same their will be a single record for the user in OLSA and a thus one consistent usage record. This means that if a user accesses an Asset in Moodle and say completes 50%, if they then access from !SkillPort using same username the asset will show that 50% completion and if they then complete it in !SkillPort that completion will be synched to Moodle.
