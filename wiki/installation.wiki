#summary Installation Process
<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />
= Introduction =
The installation process follows the standard Moodle module install process.

It is a *mandatory* requirement that PHP SOAP is enabled see http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php

Please be sure to read the [http://code.google.com/p/moodle-skillsoft-activity/source/browse/trunk/skillsoft/README.txt README.txt] contained in the download

Once installed and configured a simple diagnostics page introduced in v1.5.2 allows you to test OLSA connectivity see [olsadiag]

*IMPORTANT: Only version 2011073100 supports the situation where the Moodle Server can only access the internet via a Proxy Server.*
