<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />
= Introduction =
This Module is only supported on Moodle 1.9.x series, for a version for Moodle 2.x visit:
http://code.google.com/p/moodle2-skillsoft-activity

The installation process follows the standard Moodle module install process.

It is a *mandatory* requirement that PHP SOAP is enabled see http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php

Please be sure to read the [http://code.google.com/p/moodle-skillsoft-activity/source/browse/trunk/skillsoft/README.txt README.txt] contained in the download

Once installed and configured a simple diagnostics page introduced in v1.5.2 allows you to test OLSA connectivity see [olsadiag]

*IMPORTANT: Only version 2011073100 supports the situation where the Moodle Server can only access the internet via a Proxy Server.*


= Using the ZIP file =
  # Download the ZIP file
  # Extract all the files, ensuring folders are created, to the MOODLEHOME/mod/. You should end up with a skillsoft folder.
  # Login to Moodle as administrator
  # Click "Notifications" in the left hand menu, thsi will trigger the database table creation. Once this is completed you will be taken to the [configuration] screen

= NOTE: MySQL Database Engines =
DEC-2011 If using MySQL with MyISAM as the storage engine the installation will fail reporting an error:

{{{
1071: Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes
}}}

This is due to a limitation in MyISAM.

it is recommended to use INNODB as the storage engine. If this is not possible a workaround is to edit the file \skillsoft\db\install.xml and remove these lines from the definition for the skillsoft_report_results table (towards bottom of file). Which removes the index used to improve performance when using the "Track to OLSA (Custom Report" feature.

{{{
<INDEXES>
  <INDEX NAME="loginname-assetid-firstaccessdate" UNIQUE="true" FIELDS="loginname, assetid, firstaccessdate"/>
</INDEXES>
}}}
