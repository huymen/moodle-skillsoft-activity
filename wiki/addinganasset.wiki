= Where do I get Asset IDs from? =
It is possible to add most !SkillSoft asset types including:

  * Courses, example ids: COMM0606, en_US_41527_ng
  * Books24x7 Assets including LDC videos, example ids: 18279
  * !SkillSoft Knowledge Center, example id: kc_vb_a02_kc_enus
  * !SkillSoft Learning Programme, example id: lp_mh0001
  * !SkillBrief/!JobAid, example id: COMM0606_jco0606a


Help on retrieving these asset ids is below:

  * [RetrieveCatalogueAssetId Courses]
  * [RetrieveBookId Books]
  * [RetrieveCatalogueAssetId KnowledgeCenters]
  * [RetrieveCatalogueAssetId Learning Programmes]

There are also special ids that can be used:

  * {{{_addon_books_001}}} - This id if Books24x7 is available will log the user into the Books24x7 home page. This can be used as well as the direct links to individual [RetrieveBookId Books]

  * {{{_addon_snl_001}}} - This id will log the user into a "captive" interface on the SkillPort platform from where they can use the SkillPort Search & Learn interface to find and launch assets. _NOTE: This should only be used when using [configuration#SkillSoft_Tracking_Mode Track to OLSA] mode

  * {{{sso}}} - NEW NOVEMBER 2010. This id will log the user into the SkillPort platform from where they can use all SkillPort functions. NOTE: This is only supported when using [configuration#SkillSoft_Tracking_Mode Track to OLSA] mode
